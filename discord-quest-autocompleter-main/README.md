# QuestAutocompleter

Vencord plugin that auto-completes Discord quests. Can auto-accept quests, queue them, spoof game/stream/video progress until they're done, and auto-claim if given a captcha solver API key.

Handles reloads, account switches, and mid-session enabling without breaking.

## Setup/Install

Download `questAutocompleter.zip` from the latest release. Unzip, and make sure there is only 1 folder housing the 2 files inside it. 

Paste the folder into `Vencord/src/plugins/`, mimicking the same file structure as other plugins. Rebuild Vencord (`pnpm build`), enable in settings.

Auto-accept & auto-claim are off by default, toggle them in plugin settings if you want quests enrolled and/or claimed automatically. Auto-claim requires more setup as it needs an external captcha solver API key.

The plugin asks Discord for new quests every 2 hours. Change that in settings, minimum is 30 minutes.

Vencord must be built from source: https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/

## Achievement quests

Achievement quests (earn badges inside an activity) are handled automatically via OAuth. The plugin authorizes itself with the activity, then fires off the badge completion request after a realistic-seeming amount of time. On by default, can be toggled with "Achievement Bypass" in settings.

## Auto-claim

When a quest finishes, the plugin can automatically claim the reward for you. This requires a captcha solver since Discord gates claims behind hCaptcha.

Turn on "Auto Claim" in settings, pick a solver (NopeCHA, CapSolver, or 2Captcha), and paste your API key. If the solve fails or the key is missing, the quest just stays completed without claiming -- you can still claim manually.
